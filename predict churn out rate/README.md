# Customer Retention Prediction and Retention Campaign Strategy

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the **PROFIT** strategy for customer retention campaigns. The script predicts customer churn using machine learning, optimizes predictions with feature engineering, and identifies high-risk customers for intelligent targeting.

## Key Features

- **Predict**: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of customer churn.
- **Optimize**: Includes feature engineering techniques like calculating average monthly spend and handling categorical data.
- **Target**: Identifies high-risk customers (based on churn probability) and suggests retention strategies, such as discounts and offers.

## Use Case

Designed for the **marketing departments** of companies (e.g., telecom or subscription services) to:
- Analyze customer behavior.
- Identify customers likely to leave.
- Plan and execute targeted retention campaigns.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script with a dataset containing customer data.
3. Review the generated churn predictions and retention strategies.
